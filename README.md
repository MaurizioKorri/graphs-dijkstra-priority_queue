# Generic graph implementation and Dijkstra algorithm using priority queue 

## Graph: 
Implementation of a Graph data structure with generic types for both vertexes and edges of the graph. All various operations that are usually done in a graph are also implemented. 

## Minimum Heap:
Implementation of a generic Minumum Heap binary tree that is implemented using an ArrayList where all the positions of each element are associated with the element itself in a hashMap so that we can reduce the complexity of the fundamental DecreaseKey() operation that will later be used in the Dijkstra Algorithm.

Unit tests using JUnity are also available.
